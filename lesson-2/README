Lesson 2
--------
Work queues. Spoofs a worker queue by sleeping for each dot in the message body.
Also uses ackknowledgements to ensure messages persist if the worker dies. Uses
load balancing QoS (quality of service) to send messages to the worker that is
the least busy. Multiple workers can be spawned.

Instructions
------------
Create a simple message: php new_task.php "A simple message."

Create a complex message: php new_task.php "A complex message....."

Spawn a worker (in a separate terminal): php worker.php
