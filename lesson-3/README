Lesson 3
--------
Publish/subscribe. Demonstrates a message exchange; the producer (emit_log.php)
always pushes messages to the exchange and not a defined queue. Each spawned
worker (receive_logs.php) creates a temporary queue and binds it to the
exchange.

Instructions
------------
Create log entry: php emit_log.php "info: something happened"

Print logs to screen: php receive_logs.php

Save logs to file: php receive_logs.php > logs_from_rabbit.log
