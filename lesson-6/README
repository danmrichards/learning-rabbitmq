Lesson 6
--------
RPC. This demonstrates an RPC server and client system. This allows a client
(or consumer) to create a set of messages in an RPC queue. The server (or
producer) can consume this queue, running a callback function for each item.

The result of the callback can then be passed into an temporary queue (bound by
the client). The client then uses it's response callback function to consume the
data from the temporary queue.

Instructions
------------
Start the server: php rpc_server.php

Start the client: php rpc_client.php
